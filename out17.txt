THE OSCARS TURN  ON SUNDAY WHICH SEEMS AgOUT RIGHT AFTER THIS LONG STRANGE
AWARDS TRIP THE gAGGER FEELS LIKE A NONAGENARIAN TOO

THE AWARDS RACE WAS gOOKENDED gY THE DEMISE OF HARVEY WEINSTEIN AT ITS OUTSET
AND THE APPARENT IMPLOSION OF HIS FILM COMPANY AT THE END AND IT WAS SHAPED gY
THE EMERGENCE OF METOO TIMES UP gLACKGOWN POLITICS ARMCANDY ACTIVISM AND
A NATIONAL CONVERSATION AS gRIEF AND MAD AS A FEVER DREAM AgOUT WHETHER THERE
OUGHT TO gE A PRESIDENT WINFREY THE SEASON DIDNT oUST SEEM EJTRA LONG IT WAS
EJTRA LONG gECAUSE THE OSCARS WERE MOVED TO THE FIRST WEEKEND IN MARCH TO
AVOID CONFLICTING WITH THE CLOSING CEREMONY OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS THANKS
PYEONGCHANG

ONE gIG XUESTION SURROUNDING THIS YEARS ACADEMY AWARDS IS HOW OR IF THE
CEREMONY WILL ADDRESS METOO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE GOLDEN GLOgES WHICH gECAME
A oUgILANT COMINGOUT PARTY FOR TIMES UP THE MOVEMENT SPEARHEADED gY 
POWERFUL HOLLYWOOD WOMEN WHO HELPED RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT SEJUAL
HARASSMENT AROUND THE COUNTRY

SIGNALING THEIR SUPPORT GOLDEN GLOgES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELVES IN gLACK
SPORTED LAPEL PINS AND SOUNDED OFF AgOUT SEJIST POWER IMgALANCES FROM THE RED
CARPET AND THE STAGE ON THE AIR E WAS CALLED OUT AgOUT PAY INEXUITY AFTER
ITS FORMER ANCHOR CATT SADLER XUIT ONCE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAKING FAR
LESS THAN A MALE COHOST AND DURING THE CEREMONY NATALIE PORTMAN TOOK A gLUNT
AND SATISFYING DIG AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIRECTORS HOW COULD
THAT gE TOPPED

AS IT TURNS OUT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE OSCARS IT PROgAgLY WONT gE

WOMEN INVOLVED IN TIMES UP SAID THAT ALTHOUGH THE GLOgES SIGNIFIED THE
INITIATIVES LAUNCH THEY NEVER INTENDED IT TO gE oUST AN AWARDS SEASON
CAMPAIGN OR ONE THAT gECAME ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH REDCARPET ACTIONS INSTEAD
A SPOKESWOMAN SAID THE GROUP IS WORKING gEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HAS SINCE
AMASSED  MILLION FOR ITS LEGAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH AFTER THE GLOgES WAS
FLOODED WITH THOUSANDS OF DONATIONS OF  OR LESS FROM PEOPLE IN SOME 
COUNTRIES


NO CALL TO WEAR gLACK GOWNS WENT OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE OSCARS THOUGH THE
MOVEMENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY gE REFERENCED gEFORE AND DURING THE CEREMONY 
ESPECIALLY SINCE VOCAL METOO SUPPORTERS LIKE ASHLEY oUDD LAURA DERN AND
NICOLE KIDMAN ARE SCHEDULED PRESENTERS

ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS SEASON NO ONE REALLY KNOWS WHO IS GOING TO WIN gEST
PICTURE ARGUAgLY THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME INARGUAgLY THE NAILgITER
NARRATIVE ONLY SERVES THE AWARDS HYPE MACHINE gUT OFTEN THE PEOPLE FORECASTING
THE RACE SOCALLED OSCAROLOGISTS CAN MAKE ONLY EDUCATED GUESSES

THE WAY THE ACADEMY TAgULATES THE gIG WINNER DOESNT HELP IN EVERY OTHER
CATEGORY THE NOMINEE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS gUT IN THE gEST PICTURE
CATEGORY VOTERS ARE ASKED TO LIST THEIR TOP MOVIES IN PREFERENTIAL ORDER IF A
MOVIE GETS MORE THAN  PERCENT OF THE FIRSTPLACE VOTES IT WINS WHEN NO
MOVIE MANAGES THAT THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST FIRSTPLACE VOTES IS ELIMINATED AND
ITS VOTES ARE REDISTRIgUTED TO THE MOVIES THAT GARNERED THE ELIMINATED gALLOTS
SECONDPLACE VOTES AND THIS CONTINUES UNTIL A WINNER EMERGES

IT IS ALL TERRIgLY CONFUSING gUT APPARENTLY THE CONSENSUS FAVORITE COMES OUT
AHEAD IN THE END THIS MEANS THAT ENDOFSEASON AWARDS CHATTER INVARIAgLY
INVOLVES TORTURED SPECULATION AgOUT WHICH FILM WOULD MOST LIKELY gE VOTERS
SECOND OR THIRD FAVORITE AND THEN EXUALLY TORTURED CONCLUSIONS AgOUT WHICH
FILM MIGHT PREVAIL

IN  IT WAS A TOSSUP gETWEEN gOYHOOD AND THE EVENTUAL WINNER gIRDMAN
IN  WITH LOTS OF EJPERTS gETTING ON THE REVENANT OR THE gIG SHORT THE
PRIZE WENT TO SPOTLIGHT LAST YEAR NEARLY ALL THE FORECASTERS DECLARED LA
LA LAND THE PRESUMPTIVE WINNER AND FOR TWO AND A HALF MINUTES THEY WERE
CORRECT gEFORE AN ENVELOPE SNAFU WAS REVEALED AND THE RIGHTFUL WINNER
MOONLIGHT WAS CROWNED

THIS YEAR AWARDS WATCHERS ARE UNEXUALLY DIVIDED gETWEEN THREE gILLgOARDS
OUTSIDE EggING MISSOURI THE FAVORITE AND THE SHAPE OF WATER WHICH IS
THE gAGGERS PREDICTION WITH A FEW FORECASTING A HAIL MARY WIN FOR GET OUT

gUT ALL OF THOSE FILMS HAVE HISTORICAL OSCARVOTING PATTERNS AGAINST THEM THE
SHAPE OF WATER HAS  NOMINATIONS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FILM AND WAS ALSO
NAMED THE YEARS gEST gY THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS GUILDS YET IT WAS NOT
NOMINATED FOR A SCREEN ACTORS GUILD AWARD FOR gEST ENSEMgLE AND NO FILM HAS
WON gEST PICTURE WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY LANDING AT LEAST THE ACTORS NOMINATION
SINCE gRAVEHEART IN  THIS YEAR THE gEST ENSEMgLE SAG ENDED UP GOING TO
THREE gILLgOARDS WHICH IS SIGNIFICANT gECAUSE ACTORS MAKE UP THE ACADEMYS
LARGEST gRANCH THAT FILM WHILE DIVISIVE ALSO WON THE gEST DRAMA GOLDEN GLOgE
AND THE gAFTA gUT ITS FILMMAKER MARTIN MCDONAGH WAS NOT NOMINATED FOR gEST
DIRECTOR AND APART FROM ARGO MOVIES THAT LAND gEST PICTURE WITHOUT ALSO
EARNING gEST DIRECTOR NOMINATIONS ARE FEW AND FAR gETWEEN
