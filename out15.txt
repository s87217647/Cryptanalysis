AWARDS TRIP THE gArrER FEELS LIsE A NONArENARIAN TOO

THE AWARDS RACE WAS gOOsENDED gY THE DEMISE OF HARVEY WEINSTEIN AT ITS OUTSET
AND THE APPARENT IMPLOSION OF HIS FILM COMPANY AT THE END AND IT WAS SHAPED gY
THE EMERrENCE OF METOO TIMES UP gLACsrOWN POLITICS ARMCANDY ACTIVISM AND
A NATIONAL CONVERSATION AS gRIEF AND MAD AS A FEVER DREAM AgOUT WHETHER THERE
OUrHT TO gE A PRESIDENT WINFREY THE SEASON DIDNT oUST SEEM EJTRA LONr IT WAS
EJTRA LONr gECAUSE THE OSCARS WERE MOVED TO THE FIRST WEEsEND IN MARCH TO
AVOID CONFLICTINr WITH THE CLOSINr CEREMONY OF THE WINTER OLYMPICS THANsS
PYEONrCHANr

ONE gIr XUESTION SURROUNDINr THIS YEARS ACADEMY AWARDS IS HOW OR IF THE
CEREMONY WILL ADDRESS METOO ESPECIALLY AFTER THE rOLDEN rLOgES WHICH gECAME
A oUgILANT COMINrOUT PARTY FOR TIMES UP THE MOVEMENT SPEARHEADED gY 
POWERFUL HOLLYWOOD WOMEN WHO HELPED RAISE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIrHT SEJUAL
HARASSMENT AROUND THE COUNTRY

SIrNALINr THEIR SUPPORT rOLDEN rLOgES ATTENDEES SWATHED THEMSELVES IN gLACs
SPORTED LAPEL PINS AND SOUNDED OFF AgOUT SEJIST POWER IMgALANCES FROM THE RED
CARPET AND THE STArE ON THE AIR E WAS CALLED OUT AgOUT PAY INEXUITY AFTER
ITS FORMER ANCHOR CATT SADLER XUIT ONCE SHE LEARNED THAT SHE WAS MAsINr FAR
LESS THAN A MALE COHOST AND DURINr THE CEREMONY NATALIE PORTMAN TOOs A gLUNT
AND SATISFYINr DIr AT THE ALLMALE ROSTER OF NOMINATED DIRECTORS HOW COULD
THAT gE TOPPED

AS IT TURNS OUT AT LEAST IN TERMS OF THE OSCARS IT PROgAgLY WONT gE

WOMEN INVOLVED IN TIMES UP SAID THAT ALTHOUrH THE rLOgES SIrNIFIED THE
INITIATIVES LAUNCH THEY NEVER INTENDED IT TO gE oUST AN AWARDS SEASON
CAMPAIrN OR ONE THAT gECAME ASSOCIATED ONLY WITH REDCARPET ACTIONS INSTEAD
A SPOsESWOMAN SAID THE rROUP IS WORsINr gEHIND CLOSED DOORS AND HAS SINCE
AMASSED  MILLION FOR ITS LErAL DEFENSE FUND WHICH AFTER THE rLOgES WAS
FLOODED WITH THOUSANDS OF DONATIONS OF  OR LESS FROM PEOPLE IN SOME 
COUNTRIES


NO CALL TO WEAR gLACs rOWNS WENT OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE OSCARS THOUrH THE
MOVEMENT WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY gE REFERENCED gEFORE AND DURINr THE CEREMONY 
ESPECIALLY SINCE VOCAL METOO SUPPORTERS LIsE ASHLEY oUDD LAURA DERN AND
NICOLE sIDMAN ARE SCHEDULED PRESENTERS

ANOTHER FEATURE OF THIS SEASON NO ONE REALLY sNOWS WHO IS rOINr TO WIN gEST
PICTURE ARrUAgLY THIS HAPPENS A LOT OF THE TIME INARrUAgLY THE NAILgITER
NARRATIVE ONLY SERVES THE AWARDS HYPE MACHINE gUT OFTEN THE PEOPLE FORECASTINr
THE RACE SOCALLED OSCAROLOrISTS CAN MAsE ONLY EDUCATED rUESSES

THE WAY THE ACADEMY TAgULATES THE gIr WINNER DOESNT HELP IN EVERY OTHER
CATErORY THE NOMINEE WITH THE MOST VOTES WINS gUT IN THE gEST PICTURE
CATErORY VOTERS ARE ASsED TO LIST THEIR TOP MOVIES IN PREFERENTIAL ORDER IF A
MOVIE rETS MORE THAN  PERCENT OF THE FIRSTPLACE VOTES IT WINS WHEN NO
MOVIE MANArES THAT THE ONE WITH THE FEWEST FIRSTPLACE VOTES IS ELIMINATED AND
ITS VOTES ARE REDISTRIgUTED TO THE MOVIES THAT rARNERED THE ELIMINATED gALLOTS
SECONDPLACE VOTES AND THIS CONTINUES UNTIL A WINNER EMERrES

IT IS ALL TERRIgLY CONFUSINr gUT APPARENTLY THE CONSENSUS FAVORITE COMES OUT
AHEAD IN THE END THIS MEANS THAT ENDOFSEASON AWARDS CHATTER INVARIAgLY
INVOLVES TORTURED SPECULATION AgOUT WHICH FILM WOULD MOST LIsELY gE VOTERS
SECOND OR THIRD FAVORITE AND THEN EXUALLY TORTURED CONCLUSIONS AgOUT WHICH
FILM MIrHT PREVAIL

IN  IT WAS A TOSSUP gETWEEN gOYHOOD AND THE EVENTUAL WINNER gIRDMAN
IN  WITH LOTS OF EJPERTS gETTINr ON THE REVENANT OR THE gIr SHORT THE
PRIZE WENT TO SPOTLIrHT LAST YEAR NEARLY ALL THE FORECASTERS DECLARED LA
LA LAND THE PRESUMPTIVE WINNER AND FOR TWO AND A HALF MINUTES THEY WERE
CORRECT gEFORE AN ENVELOPE SNAFU WAS REVEALED AND THE RIrHTFUL WINNER

THE gArrERS PREDICTION WITH A FEW FORECASTINr A HAIL MARY WIN FOR rET OUT

gUT ALL OF THOSE FILMS HAVE HISTORICAL OSCARVOTINr PATTERNS ArAINST THEM THE
SHAPE OF WATER HAS  NOMINATIONS MORE THAN ANY OTHER FILM AND WAS ALSO
NAMED THE YEARS gEST gY THE PRODUCERS AND DIRECTORS rUILDS YET IT WAS NOT
NOMINATED FOR A SCREEN ACTORS rUILD AWARD FOR gEST ENSEMgLE AND NO FILM HAS
WON gEST PICTURE WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY LANDINr AT LEAST THE ACTORS NOMINATION
SINCE gRAVEHEART IN  THIS YEAR THE gEST ENSEMgLE SAr ENDED UP rOINr TO
